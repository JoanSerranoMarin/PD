# Parkinson's disease analysis
Here is a code that allows for performing metabolomics and RNA-Seq analysis. We used it for analyzing RNAseq and Mass Spectrometry data derived from aqueous humor from participants, and microglia from mice. Note that part of the code was done by Marc Subías (Bachelor's student in 2023) under the supervision of Joan Serrano-Marín (PhD candidate in 2023).
